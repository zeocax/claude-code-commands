Analyze the project or component in the folder: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps:

1. Ultrathink: Analyze the folder contents in detail, aiming for comprehensive documentation 
2. Record to a single comprehensive documentation file that covers all analyzed content
3. Update the ProjectArchitecture in CLAUDE.md and make sure content from this analysis is properly referenced:
   - Include link to the documentation file created in this analysis using @docs/xxx.md format
   - If only analyzing part of the project, briefly explore the broader project structure to understand context
   - Describe how analyzed components and modules fit into the overall project architecture
   - Focus on relationships and interactions with existing components rather than isolated details
   - Verify that the architecture overview accurately reflects the analyzed structure
